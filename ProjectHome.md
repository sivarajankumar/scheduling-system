**4.How to avoid plagiarism**

There are two broad ways to approach this topic:

First, you can try to make plagiarism less tempting, by explaining what the punishments for getting caught include.Instead of just using the penalties as deterrent, we may want to help the students see the value of the assignments.
Second, you can try to make plagiarism less easy. This can be accomplished by requiring thesis statements, annotated bibliographies, or class presentations on the term paper topic; alternatively, we could have the students complete a series of shorter assignments that build up to the final paper.


**5.Exam if your proposed project (idea, sentence, etc) violates rules**

we have gone through some previous projects in google code hosting, from that we got a
new idea to implement it and Dr.Frank XU gave some ideas to approach the project.
